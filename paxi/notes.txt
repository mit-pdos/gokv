## Why unique proposal numbers?
As described in Paxos Made Simple [1], the mention of needing "unique proposal
numbers" seems to imply that replicas _start_ with ownership of various proposal
numbers, and they can freely select the command to propose with that proposal
number (subject to some invariants, of course).

Another way to do this is for Phase1 to act more like leader election, and make
it so that each successful Phase1() results in the leader-to-be ending up with
resources representing the fact that the replica voted for it for that proposal
number. With a majority of these witnesses, the leader could get ownership of
the proposal number of ouf some invariant.

Concretely, this is the difference this makes in code:
if you assume that replicas can pick unique proposal numbers, then other
replicas can respond "yes" to multiple Phase1() RPCs.
Without knowing that replicas pick unique proposal numbers, the replica has to
rememebr who it voted for in this proposal number and only repeat "yes" replies
back to that replica (basically Raft leader election).
