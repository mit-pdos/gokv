## valPN vs promisedPN

Right now, when we accept a new proposal, we can increase logPN without
increasing promisedPN. This is safe (and matches most closely with Paxos Made
Simple).

To be closer to raft, we could maintain in our mu invariant that logPN <=
promisedPN, which would allow us to get rid of some checks against valPN in the
code. That would match more closely with how Raft is described.
