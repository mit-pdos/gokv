= Reconfiguration

Consider a system that works like this.
Upon initialization, none of the replica servers think they are the primary.
There are some old servers out there that have no


Replica.
* ReplicateOp(epoch uint64, op []byte, opindex uint64) (err {EStale, ENone})
  Called by the primary to replicate an operation to backups.
* EnterNewEpoch(epoch uint64)
* GetState(epoch uint64) (state []byte)
* Op(op []byte) (err {ENone, ENotPrimary}, ret []byte)
  Called by the client of the system to try applying a new operation.
  If err=ENotPrimary, the operation might still be applied/end up being applied.
* SetState(epoch uint64)

* BecomePrimary(epoch uint64, backups []grove_ffi.Address)

Config.
* GetNewEpoch() uint64
* SetConfig(epoch uint64)
