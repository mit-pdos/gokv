Setup:
* 1 fixed (never crashing) config server
* 2 fixed (never crashing) ctr servers
* multiple of front-end servers, each trying to be the primary front-end that
  clients talk to
* a client machine (never crashing) that does fetch-and-increment forever

The client machine tries doing a fetch-and-increment against a front-end server.
If it can't, the client machine fetches the latest active front-end from the
config server.

As long as the config and the front-end can reach each other, the front-end is
considered OK.  So, if we end up in a situation where the client can't reach the
front-end, but the config server can reach the front-end, we consider that to be
the "client's problem" in the same way as if the client were partitioned from
the config server itself. Technically, it could be a problem with the current
front-end server, and require intervention on the part of the front-end.

(ncon start 1 "go run ./config")
(ncon start 2 "go run ./config")
(ncon start 3 "go run ./config")
