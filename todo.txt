Get()s don't need to go through the reply table. Even if there are multiple
distinct GetReplies sent to the client, only one of them will actually make it
back, and the one that gets received first determines the linearization point of
the Get().

With Get()s of large values, if we put the Value in the reply table, then the
reply table has to support both GetReply and PutReply types. If we don't put the
Get() value in the reply table, that goes away.

More importantly, we also probably don't need to use cid/seq so we can avoid
needing writing anything to disk. That might substantially improve Get()
performance.
